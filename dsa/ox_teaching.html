        <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">  I have been teaching this module since 2019 and have been a sole lecturer and module leader. I prepared all lecture notes, slides, exams, seminar questions, and solutions.  Over the years, I have revised all content and then redesigned and restructured this module in terms of both content and delivery methods. I believe by the help of these improvements, the module became <strong>the most popular graduate module </strong> in the department. Also, I introduced the Twitter hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23EC916&src=typed_query&f=live" target="_blank"> (#EC916)</a>  to increase engagements with students and connection to content out of class. I believe this enhanced student learning a lot and kept them always updated by connecting real-world examples.  I have used Vevox for almost every lecture  to have more interactive lectures. Also, to get personal feedback and small test, I have used Qualtrics regularly. As much research showed that many macroeconomics textbooks had barely changed and lagged behind the practice of economics, hence I designed this module's notes/slides not depend on textbooks but on recent-updated journal papers. In addition, I always use real-world examples by introducing non-academic journal articles, and I can comfortably say that this is loved by students and increase their motivation since they see that materials touch the real world.  </div> </p>

For Economic Analysis: Macroeconomics with the Covid-19, I redesigned all lectures, questions and answers of EC9012 materials to fit online teaching. These slides have been used by teaching fellows and GTAs. Those Latex Beamers helped a lot for those who teach this module for the first time in the era of Covid-19.  Also, I have helped test and main exam questions to module lecturers over the two years. I have been marking and moderating this module over the years too.  </div> </p>

In the first term they learn micro and in the second term they will learn macro which I teach alone as a lecturer. I have preapred and redesigned the module. In other words, I prepared everything from zero. This module is mainly for  maths and statistics students, and for that reason, I  constructed a modern approach by considering evidence/data based curriculum. I  divided the module into three parts 1) Theory/Concepts 2) Real World Connection 3) Tools. In the concept part, by using the standard approach, I cover important topics. In the real-world connection part, we look at those concepts in a real-world framework by considering recent/related economic and financial historical events. For the final part, I  introduce how those concepts can be applied and replicated again with an empirical approach. For this part, I  mainly use the QuantEcon and Our World In Data source and some other materials I prepared by myself.  </div> </p>

I meet my students two times in a week both as a class and one-to-one meeting.   Moreover, I have always been keen on my student's further careers; thus, I help them with their job applications and their materials (CV, SoP, Cover Letter etc.) in addition to formal supervising. I  have regular meetings with them to improve their CV and redesign the cover letters of my final year students. I have never written a standard/generic reference letter but a very specific and program-oriented letter. Before finalising the letter, I meet my students, learn their career plans, discuss the details of the program, and check their CVs and Cover letters; then, I write a letter. For that reason, I believe many of my previous students are still in contact with me and ask similar questions, too, even after a couple of years since they believe that I am doing this not for the sake of doing it or as a duty. </p>

The first themse is Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, central bank digital currency. To investigate this theme we ask the question whether Bitcoin will become the money of the future? The second topic is Global Climate Crises and Financial Stability. Almost all around the world central banks are responsibly of financial stability of their domestic economy. However, in a  financially interconnected world climate change bring a fresh challenges which is global and beyond the capacity of many central banks around the world. For that reason, the collective acction is neccesary. We discuss potential problems and solutions ways. Last, we focus on the recent developments in data science and  how these technological andvances will affect financial markets and financial decisions.

  Every year I supervise 12 BSc Economics students for their final year dissertations and five master students in finance and economics students at the Warwick Business School and the Department of Economics every year. Also, I marked many master dissertations as a first as well as a second marker. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the year I have been approached by many students with some 'hot topics' like machine learning and high-frequency finance topics.  In order to increase my ability to supervise on these topics, last year \textbfI used my research fund to buy high-frequency dataset and learn how to conduct research with this kind of data. Also in this year again by using my research fund, I've joined the summer school of "Machine Learning in Macroeconomics" which is organized by the University of Oxford. I have also took some Udemy/Coursera programming MOOCS modules. Thus, I can say that, next years, I will be more ready to answer those requests from students.
  
  <br>
   At the moment, I am supervising four master students and two of them are working on Text Mining with machine learning technique, one of them is going to focus on high-frequency data (I am going to partly provide the dataset too).

  I have always seen myself a learner. Although I am a social scientist, I learned web design and web programming (HTML), Python language, and graphic and video editing programs such as Adobe Premiere from various sources like Udemy, Coursera and of course YouTube. In Covid-19,  many things and roles had to be transformed, and education is no exception. During this time, I used all my IT knowledge and experiences for my own sake and teaching for my students. I have created many videos,  tutorials and documents. I used all updated tools and resources to manage classrooms and engage students remotely.  <br>
  <br>

<b> In 2021 I was nominated for a Warwick Award for Teaching Excellence</b> which is one of the most prestigious award in Warwick.In addition, although, I had started the application process before the Covid-19 period, I cancelled/deferred the process. However, I am in progress to be a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy at the moment.

  Recently, I have been granted fund for two different projects. The first one is a reasearch project and the second one is teaching project.  In the research project, we are going to check and rank the communication channel and efficiency of central banks by considering climate change policy over the world. Since, an effective communication can help to shape the view of public and increase the policy effectiveness. In this regard, for example, the Guardian newspaper has recently changed their language on climate matters, and they no longer use "climate change" but "climate crisis” since it is a crisis, not a change. In a similar manner, by using natural language processing method, we are going to rank the central banks according to their sensitivity of this issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  My second project is to create modenr macroeconomics/finance module by embedded programming and data. This will be  a  Python-based introduction to macroeconomic course for undergraduate and/or graduate students. By using Python - a free open source programming language- student will integrate theoretical models with publicly available macroeconomic data. By the end of the course students will get strong experiences on downloading and managing macroeconomic data, analysis and preparing data visualisations, solving models of dynamic optimisation in addition to learn the basics of computer programming and most used Python libraries by economists such as Matplotlib, NumPy, and pandas.
        <br>
        <br>
The project will simply create lecture materials by integrating python codes. For example, for the topics of unemployment, having learned the fundamental concepts of unemployment student will touch real data. In this frame of unemployment student will learn how and where to get unemployment data. In this regard we will specific code to make a plot of the unemployment rate by downloading unemployment rate data from FRED (or ONS). This will be provided to students. Also, we are going to create fortnightly homework assignments and group projects for students. These materials are going test students both macroeconomic knowledge as well as programming skills.

      <strong>   Outline of the Project:</strong>
      
      The era of one policy objective –inflation targeting– and one tool – interest rates – is over for the central banks for the sake of financial stability. Today, there are many challenges that central banks have to face and climate crisis is at the top of the list. To deliver financial stability in a world that is now so financially interconnected poses fresh challenges such as climate risk and recent pandemic which affects the two policy goals pursued by central banks, financial and monetary stability. Central banks need to not just adapt to changing conditions but equip new tools too.
      <br> 
      
      Apart from macroprudential tool central banks has another powerful tool: communication. Communication has become as important financial monitoring and management to effective central bank operations. If done well, communication can strengthen understanding of central bank objectives by market agent as well as public, help shape the market mood and provide reassurance in times of stress.
      <br> 
      
      In this project, we are going to check and rank the communication channel and efficiency of central banks climate change policy over the world. Since, an effective communication can help to shape the view of public and increase the policy effectiveness. In this regard, for example, the Guardian newspaper has recently changed their language on climate matters, and they no longer use "climate change" but "climate crisis” since it is a crisis, not a change.
